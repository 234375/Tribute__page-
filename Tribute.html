      <h3 class="heading3"><I>The father of algebra</i></h3>
      <p><b style="font-size:20px">Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī</b> was a Persian Muslim <span style="color:purple"> MATHEMATESHIAN,ASTRONOMER, and GEOGRAPHER</span> who lived during the Islamic Golden Age. He was born around 780 CE in Khwarazm (present-day Uzbekistan) and worked at the House of Wisdom in Baghdad.</p><br>
<p>
Al-Khwarizmi’s most influential work was in mathematics, especially in the development of algebra. In fact, the word "algebra" comes from the title of his book *Kitab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala*. His systematic approach to solving linear and quadratic equations laid the foundation for much of modern algebra.
</p>
<p>
His name gave rise to the term "algorithm," which is central to computer science today. In addition to math, he contributed significantly to astronomy and geography, and his works were translated into Latin and used across Europe for centuries.</p>
<p>
He passed away around 850 CE, leaving behind a legacy that shaped the future of science and technology.</p><br>
